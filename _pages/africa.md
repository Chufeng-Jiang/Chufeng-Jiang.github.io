# Life in Africa 2017 - 2020

<span style="font-family: Century Schoolbook;color:rgb(112,128,144);">"Nothing's ever for sure, John. That's the only sure thing I do know."</span>

Life in Africa was far more challenging than I had anticipated. 

The first country I went to was Ethiopia, a nation known for its high-altitude terrain. During my first two weeks there, I suffered from severe altitude sickness, which made adjusting even more difficult. I worked as a junior accountant, responsible for managing cash and overseeing daily financial transactions for the company and various construction sites.

It was during that time that Mr. Gajo and the local staff gave me the English name I use today: Beza. This is a common Ethiopian name that carries deep meaningâ€”"a gift from God" or "medicine from heaven." Years later, while studying at San Francisco Bay University, my classmates shared that "Beza" also holds the meaning of "good luck" in certain contexts, further enriching its significance to me.
