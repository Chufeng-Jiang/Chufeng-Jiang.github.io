I an incoming PhD student in the Computer Science Program at [*The City University of New York*](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/computer-science), where I will be advised by [Dr. Raffi Khatchadourian](https://khatchad.commons.gc.cuny.edu/). Currently, I am pursuing an MS in Computer Science at *The University of Texas at Austin*.

My research interests lie in <span style="color:rgb(255,0,0);">***Software Engineering***</span>, <span style="color:rgb(255,0,0);">***Programming Language***</span>, and <span style="color:rgb(255,0,0);">***Machine Learning System***</span>. I am particularly interested in:

- How automated refactoring and program analysis might lessen the load of correctly, quickly, and safely evolving large and complicated software; 
- How to enhance and facilitate the long-term evolution of Machine Learning systems utilizing Software Engineering approaches. 

I have published 10+ papers at different international journals and conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6i-r0JIAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>. 

I am actively seeking a<span style="color:rgb(255,0,0);"> **2025 Summer Software Engineering Internship**</span>, or <span style="color:rgb(255,0,0);">**Summer Laboratory Research Internship**</span>. Kindly please feel free to connect with me if anything interests you.
