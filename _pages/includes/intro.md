**What is Technical Debt?** <br>
Technical debt refers to the <strong>long-term costs</strong> incurred by taking <strong>shortcuts</strong> during implementation and deployment. These costs can hinder maintenance, scalability, and improvements over time. In ML Systems, unchecked technical debt can degrade model performance, increase operational costs, and stifle
long-term innovation (Sculley *et al.*, 2015/2021; *Tang et al.*,2021; Tom *et al.*, 2013)

This involves mining code and data across diverse models to identify refactorings that specifically target ML-related technical debt. Additionally, I aim to develop innovative refactoring techniques at both the code and data levels, integrating object-oriented practices to simplify and enhance the maintainability of complex, interdependent models. <!-- I have published some papers at different international journals and conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7ak4omcAAAAJ&hl=en'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>. -->

I obtained my Master of Science in Computer Science (Bridge Program) in 2022 from *University of Birmingham (**Dubai**)*, co-advised by [Dr. Mian M. Hamayun](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/dubai/hamayun-mian) and [Dr. Ahmad Ibrahim](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~ibrahima/). I received my Second Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science and Technology in 2023 from *Nankai University*, advised by [Dr. Haiwei Zhang](https://dbis.nankai.edu.cn/2023/0322/c12139a506916/page.htm). 

In addition, I am awarded an MBA degree in 2024 from *San Francisco Bay University*, advised by [Dr. Flora Chu](https://www.sfbu.edu/academics/faculty/business), and completed my Bachelor of Management in Accounting (ACCA) in 2017 from *Hunan University*, advised by [Dr. Yanyan Jiang](http://grzy.hnu.edu.cn/site/index/jiangyanyan) along with a Bachelor of Science in Applied Accounting in 2019 from *Oxford Brookes University*, mentored by [Ms. Ying Ju (ICF ACC Coach)](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/ixaDwDDQntNm-936hc-HnA). 

During 2017.07 - 2020.10, I worked for different ***<span style="color:rgb(0,100,0);"><u>China Foreign Infrastructure Aid Projects</u></span>*** in  Africa countries such as **Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria**, where I participated in the construction of Railways, Airports, Hospitals, and other facilities.
