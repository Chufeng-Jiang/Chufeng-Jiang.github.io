[Mixup-CLIPood: Robust Domain Generalization for Multi-modal Object Recognition](https://github.com/Yuxin_Qiao/NewCLIPood) \\
Yuxin Qiao, Keqin Li, Junhong Lin, Rong Wei, **Chufeng Jiang**, Yang Luo, Haoyu Yang.

- [**Contribution**](https://github.com/Yuxin_Qiao/NewCLIPood) <strong></strong>

  - We address the incongruity between the actual loss and the one documented in the paper. Through a meticulous analysis of implementations, we deduce the actual loss and compare it with the documented loss.
  - We expand our experiments to encompass two larger vision-language backbones. This comprehensive evaluation provides a more robust assessment of the method's performance.
  - We propose Mixup-CLIPood with a novel mix-up loss to enhance the previous model's generalization ability by incorporating class-aware visual information during training.

[**Research Questions**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10350) <strong></strong>

- Q1: What methodologies are employed in LLMs for forecasting in different domains?
  - Different domains, such as finance, healthcare, weather, and retail, may require unique adaptations of LLMs to address domain-specific challenges and data characteristics. This question aims to explore and categorize the different methodologies and techniques used in LLMs for forecasting tasks, providing insights into their applicability across different sectors.

- Q2: How effective are LLMs in detecting anomalies compared to traditional anomaly detection methods?
  - Anomalies often exhibit distinct characteristics across diverse contexts, such as outlier financial transactions, atypical network traffic patterns, and unanticipated variations in health data. This question seeks to evaluate the performance and accuracy of LLMs in identifying outliers or unusual patterns in data, contrasting their effectiveness with that of conventional anomaly detection techniques.

- Q3: What are the limitations and challenges of using LLMs for forecasting and anomaly detection?
  - LLMs present a transformative potential for revolutionizing forecasting and anomaly detection due to their advanced pattern recognition and predictive capabilities. This question intends to identify the current limitations, challenges, and potential areas of improvement in using LLMs for these purposes, including factors like data prerequisites, computational expenditures, and model interpretability.

- **Academic Impact**: This paper is selected to present in a Collaborative Study and Research Group on Related Literature [时序时空大模型读书会启动：大模型开启时序时空数据挖掘新视角](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzIzMjQyNzQ5MA==&mid=2247686949&idx=1&sn=7ac5abf22610981adf2404a7e687542d&chksm=e9174944e3bc883a8b1e14392e05e90ba75b9023d4237f594b139d1643aa3928c6191fe2dc24&scene=27).
